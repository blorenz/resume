                                        per bracket elimination. The final four schools then faced three 24 hour
                                        social media challenges to accrue points. The winner was crowned at the

                                        application. The Flash training application was a mature training simulation
                                        in its third iteration that required a 3-D environment to engage and entertain

                                    <p>Architected software system in Win32 and C++ that created a scalable,
                                        distributed processing network for real-time face recognition and logging.
                                        The desktop application integrated a framework which included PHP and MySQL
                                        for backend processing and distribution of results. The software system
                                        included an operator application that infers faces in an arbitrary number
                                        of agnostic video and image feeds; extracts the facial regions; logs video
                                        clips of events; issues work orders that encapsulate the extracted regions
                                        to remotely-hosted Master clients; retrieves the results of completed work
                                        orders; and presents the results of sightings in a flexible user interface
                                        using an intuitive user experience. The Master clients were each in charge
                                        of an arbitrary number of Slave clients. The Masters were aware of current
                                        Slave resource usage and Slave resource potential; dictated work orders
                                        from the Operator application to underworked Slaves; monitored current
                                        performance and dynamically load-balanced work orders; and delivered completed
                                        results to the Operator application. The Slave clients received job requests
                                        from their Master application. The Slave was distributed a gallery of images
                                        to analyze work orders against; process job requests and issue results
                                        back to its Master. The Slave client was written as a lightweight, portable
                                        application intended to be quickly integrated into a variety of machine
                                        architectures and operating system types in order to leverage those system’s
                                        resource in a cloud computing environment. The Camera Enhancer application
                                        was developed to abstract specialized camera interfaces from the Operator.
                                        The Operator application accepts the Camera Enhancer was a network video
                                        feed. The Camera Enhancer can control Pan-Tilt-Zoom cameras, permitting
                                        the Operator to programmatically exercise target tracking and persistence.
                                        The Camera Enhancer can also deploy any web cam as a network-enabled video
                                        surveillance system for remote extractions and identifications. In support
                                        of the distributed recognition environment, I developed a BlackBerry application
                                        suite that integrated the mobile device into the distributed processing
                                        environment as a producer and a consumer of data content. This included
                                        two applications that were written in J2ME. One application was purposed
                                        to enroll new images and videos, that were created by the BlackBerry, as
                                        indentified persons in the galleries to recognize against. The second application
                                        would retrieve results after submitting images or videos to detect known
                                        persons in the content. I wrote customized controls to intuitively and
                                        optimally present the user with the results within the constraints of a
                                        mobile handheld system.</p>

                                    <p>Two years full development cycle for proprietary hardware targeting Texas
                                        Instruments’ DaVinci DVEVM6446 on an embedded Linux system utilizing both
                                        CPU and DSP which was designed, implemented, debugged and maintained during
                                        the scope of the project. This project targeted the MILES-CVS force-on-force
                                        combat exercise system. My company designed and developed a hardware device
                                        to inject visual tracers into both the optical and digital video path of
                                        the vehicle gunner and commander. This solution was to resolve an absence
                                        in realism when conducting field exercises when the gunner would not receive
                                        sensory feedback from firing the laser-modification of the weapon systems.
                                        I served as lead software engineer. The hardware consisted of five TI DaVinci
                                        chips that demanded a multi-processor software architecture. My system
                                        communicated inter-processor and distributed tasks accordingly to CPU load
                                        and processor scope and responsibility. The TI DaVinci chip also contained
                                        a DSP and I had to port an OpenGL ES implementation to run on the DSP asynchronously
                                        from the CPU to lower the resource usage of the CPU. I also modified the
                                        graphics implementation to natively support the DaVinci architecture. Besides
                                        developing the graphical representation of the munitions that were fired,
                                        I was responsible for traveling to sites and acquiring data from and resolving
                                        integration matters on the targeted vehicles. Among these sites were four
                                        government military installations and two military vehicle manufacturers,
                                        some which were traveled to many times. During the site visits, I would
                                        gather data from vehicle ports; conduct tests to validate data; integrate
                                        the current solutions; modify non-working implementations; and troubleshoot
                                        any problems that arose. As vehicle access time was a premium, this continuously
                                        challenged me to think critically and create working solutions in a very
                                        short order of time. My system had a dependency of another vehicle augment
                                        system that was being developed concurrently. I had to implement procedures
                                        and protocols to communicate to that parent system while also maintaining
                                        direct communication with current vehicle state. I also created a robust,
                                        in-house vehicle simulator in .NET C# to replicate vehicle interactions
                                        in the laboratory environment. This permitted a better use of time when
                                        afforded actual vehicle access and prevented pitfalls that were already
                                        identified in the lab.</p>
