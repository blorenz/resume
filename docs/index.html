                                        the application provided the ability to register for the official PINK
                                        Nation Spring Break party to be held in Miami. The user could register
                                        and receive a digital invitation to admit them to the event. Users who
                                        could not attend the official party were able to access a store locator
                                        to attend an in-store experience. On the day of the Miami party, the application
                                        switched to a phase that would monitor certain hashtags on social media
                                        feeds. The Simul Party experience provided a colorful visualization of
                                        the frequency and intensity of the hashtag mentions.</p>

                        to youth education. I have served as a mentor for the Coding Club at Liberty
