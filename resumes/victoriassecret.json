      "description": "This was a major undertaking that resulted in a complete rewrite of the third-party code. Their codebase was used as a guideline but since the language and framework had changed we could not reuse their previous work. Groovy and Grails were chosen because of the stipulation that the infrastructure partners ran on a JVM and we had to have something compliant with that.",
      "summary": "PINK Nation existed as a portal on a third-party site and developed by third-party developers. This endeavour brought the experience in-house and under a new platform based on the Grails web application framework powered by the Groovy language.",
